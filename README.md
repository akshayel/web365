## Purpose
__Written on Jan 1, 2022__ - By Jan 1, 2023, I want to have the ability to build functional Web 3 applications. 

I currently know nothing about web development, so I need to start from scratch. 
I want to challenge myself to create something I couldn't do before within a 1 hour time span.

This project is a fun way for me to get in the practice of learning how to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Rules
1. Learn 1 new thing every day
1. Implement what I learned by creating something from it
