## Purpose
__Written on Jan 1, 2022__ - By Jan 1, 2023, I want to have the ability to build functional Web 3 applications. 

I currently know nothing about web development, so I need to start from scratch. 
I want to challenge myself to create something I couldn't do before within a 1 hour time span.

This project is a fun way for me to get in the practice of learning how to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Rules
1. Learn 1 new thing every day
1. Implement what I learned by creating something from it

## Reflections
__Day 1__ - I wish I knew how to lay elements out on a page. I found that surprisingly difficult. Laying out a form is tough.

__Day 2__ - HTML is easy, but CSS is a little bit more complicated. Still wish I knew how to lay out pages.

__Day 3__ - Figured out how to have divs sit side by side, and be responsive if the screen size changes. Wish I knew how to create a nicer looking page in general.

__Day 4__ - Figured out CSS Flexbox! Next step is to figure out how to use and create grids, then make a full static page.

__Day 5__ - Made a simple layout using CSS Grid.

__Day 6__ - Made a little toggle button using JavaScript.

__Day 7__ - Used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ) to replicate the Chrome dinosaur game.

__Day 8__ - Made an alert for a signup button for a form.

__Day 9__ - Learned about the different types of CSS selectors.

__Day 10__ - Learned about psuedo classes and psuedo elements today.

__Day 11__ - Learned about borders and boxes. Learned how to use border radius to create interesting shapes.
