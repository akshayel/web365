# 365 days to Web 3.0

## Purpose
__Written on Dec 31, 2021__ - By Jan 1, 2023, I want to be proficient enough at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Solidity to build functional Web 3.0 applications. 

As of Dec 31, 2021, I'm not actually sure if this is enough to build Web 3.0 apps. Hopefully I'll figure that out as I learn more.
