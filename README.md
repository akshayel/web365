## Purpose
__Written on Jan 1, 2022__ - By Jan 1, 2023, I want to have the ability to build functional Web 3 applications. 

I currently know nothing about web development, so I need to start from scratch. 
I want to challenge myself to build the best possible website in 1 hour based on what I've learned the days before.

This project is a fun way for me to get in the practice of learning how to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Rules
1. Try to build the best site or app I can in 1 hour
2. Implement something I learned the day before
3. Write 1 thing I wish I could do but don't know how to yet

## Reflections
__Day 1__ - I wish I knew how to lay elements out on a page. I found that surprisingly difficult. Laying out a form is tough.
__Day 2__ - HTML is easy, but CSS is a little bit more complicated. Still wish I knew how to lay out pages.
